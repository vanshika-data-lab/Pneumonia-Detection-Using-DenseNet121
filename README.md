# Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning
A deep learning web application for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images using transfer learning with DenseNet121, deployed with Streamlit.

# Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images as either # NORMAL or ## PNEUMONIA. The model uses transfer learning with DenseNet121 architecture and achieves high accuracy with medical-grade evaluation metrics.
